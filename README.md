# Control-O-Bot-simulation💥⏭
Simulation of Line Following+ Obstacle avoidance Automated Robot which detects obstacles on th gri and reaches the end point following the shortest path possible using webots software.
## Intallation guides🏁🏁
 ### ✔Installation of Pycharm, Cpp compiler, Python compiler
### ✔ Webots installation guides
 install Webots-R2020-rev1. On your laptop/desktop, install the installer from: https://cyberbotics.com/#download and follow the steps given below:  
1. Run webot-R2020-rev1_setup.exe , then choose first option i.e. install for me only. 
2. Select the path where you want to install Webots, and click next. 
3. Select the folder, and click next. 
4. Click install to continue installation. 
5. Now the installation will start. Wait for few minutes until all the files are extracted.
6. To continue, click finish.
7. Now, Webots is installed, you can open it from the desktop (if you selected the shortcut option) or from the installation directory.   
8. Now select theme of your choice and click next.
9. And now, your software is properly installed and is ready for use as per your requirements. 

## Prerequisites and learning resources🏁🏁
### ✔Python- Basics, Functions, Conditional statements, Arrays, Open CV, Data structure and algorithms.
Resources-
1. Learn Python By Example; https://www.learnbyexample.org/python/ 
2. Wikibooks: Python Programing; https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming 

### ✔C++- Basics, variables, functions, decision making statements, arrays and pointers.
Resources-
1. https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/ 
2. https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-tutorial 

### ✔Basics of Robot
1. The IMU- Inertial Measurement Unit
2. GPS Receiver Module
3. GPS Module
4. Distance Sensor- LED, LIDAR, Ultrasonic, Range finder, VCSEL
5. Actuators and motors.

### ✔Webots Simulation Software
Webots is a professional mobile robot simulation software package. It offers a rapid prototyping environment that allows the user to create 3D virtual worlds with physics properties such as mass, joints, friction coefficients, etc.
Resources: 
1. Webots Documentation- https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/index
2. References- https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials?tab-language=c++ 
3. Sample webots applications-  The example worlds can be tested easily; the ".wbt" files are located in various "worlds" directories of the "WEBOTS_HOME/projects" directory and can be directly opened from Webots using the Open Sample World item in File menu. The controller code is located in the corresponding "controllers" directory. 
4. Devices: Most of the devices use a simple two-wheeled blue robot called MyBot moving in a closed square arena containing obstacles. The studied devices are attached on this robot. MyBot moves and avoid obstacles using two DistanceSensors and a technique based on Braitenberg vehicles.

## What to develop?🏁🏁
### ✔Problem statement:
The detailed version of the objective to be achieved is given in the probleem statement file.
### ✔Arena Design
The various arena design is provided in the various arena.wbt files present. 
🛑 Try design your own complex arena version and then run your bot on it. It will be very exciting💯.
### ✔Bot Design on webots
Try experimenting with different designs on webots. The beeter the bot design, the easier will it be to code for the desired objective and the smoother the bot will move.
### ✔Controller
The final code for the simulation of your own robot on webots. It could be in any programming languages like, C++, C, MATLAB, Java, Python.

💥So design your very own bot, simulate it online and watch it performing cool stuffs. Happy developing👍.
